## This is a README file
A non functional, optional document that gives some information about this repository. 
Similarly, you can create a repo named README in github and create a custom bio at github.com/<your username>/README.
Heres mine: https://github.com/calebrlx/README
README documents can be formated using markdown (.md) or in plain text (.txt)
The basics of markdown
'''
# - Used to depict a header
## - Used to depict a header, but smaller
'''
Then the rest is pretty much plain text or you can go into more detail (here)[https://github.com]
